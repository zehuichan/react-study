<!--
  Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
  It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

  Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
  https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

  In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
  https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

  You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
